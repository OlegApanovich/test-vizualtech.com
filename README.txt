Write a WordPress plugin that adds a HelloBar style banner on every page of a site.
* Assume the site theme uses standard get_header() and get_footer()
* Include an admin page to edit the text of the banner and give an option to display the banner at the top or bottom of the page.
* Style the banner to clearly and attractively display content. Don't get too caught up in making it fancy. Just show that you can handle a little CSS.
* Please use any information at your disposal. WordPress Code Reference is very helpful.
